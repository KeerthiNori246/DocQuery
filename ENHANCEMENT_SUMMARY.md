- ‚úÖ **Crystal clear feature status**: Users know exactly what's available and what's missing
- ‚úÖ **One-click enhancement**: Automated installation of optional features
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent error handling**: Specific guidance for each type of issue
- ‚úÖ **Progressive capability**: Basic ‚Üí Enhanced ‚Üí Full AI workflow

### Technical Improvements:
- **Zero regression**: All 20 existing tests continue to pass
- **Better performance**: Only loads features when dependencies are available
- **Scalable architecture**: Easy to add new optional features
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive type hints and error handling

## üöÄ User Journey Enhancement

### New User Experience:
1. **Installation**: Clear basic vs enhanced installation options
2. **First Run**: Immediate feedback about system capabilities
3. **Feature Discovery**: Proactive suggestions for improvements
4. **Error Recovery**: Helpful guidance when issues occur
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Easy path to full functionality

### Example Improvement - Word Document Support:
