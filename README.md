# LLM-Powered Intelligent Query-Retrieval System

An advanced document analysis system designed for real-world scenarios in insurance, legal, HR, and compliance domains. The system processes large documents and makes contextual decisions with explainable rationale.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-format Document Processing**: Supports PDFs, DOCX, and email documents
- **Semantic Search**: Uses FAISS/TF-IDF embeddings for intelligent document retrieval
- **Natural Language Processing**: Advanced query parsing and understanding
- **Domain-Specific Analysis**: Specialized logic for insurance, legal, HR, and compliance
- **Contextual Decision Making**: Explainable AI decisions with detailed justification
- **Structured Output**: Comprehensive JSON responses with metadata and audit trails

### Key Components

#### 1. Document Processor (`document_processor.py`)
- Extracts text from PDFs, DOCX, and email files
- Intelligent text chunking with overlap for better semantic search
- Handles encrypted PDFs and complex document structures

#### 2. Enhanced Query Parser (`query_parser.py`)
- Extracts structured information from natural language queries
- Recognizes age, gender, procedures, locations, policy details
- Classifies queries by domain (insurance, legal, HR, compliance)
- Handles complex real-world query patterns

#### 3. Vector Search Engine (`vector_search.py`, `enhanced_vector_search.py`)
- FAISS-based semantic search with sentence transformers
- TF-IDF fallback for enhanced compatibility
- Domain-specific term expansion and semantic matching
- Multiple search algorithms with automatic fallback

#### 4. AI Analysis Engine (`local_ai_client.py`)
- Local AI processing without external API dependencies
- Domain-specific analysis for different query types
- Multi-factor scoring algorithms
- Risk assessment and confidence scoring
- Comprehensive recommendation generation

#### 5. Output Formatter (`output_formatter.py`)
- Structured JSON output with industry-standard schema
- Domain-specific metadata and analysis details
- Audit trail and compliance information
- Export capabilities for integration
