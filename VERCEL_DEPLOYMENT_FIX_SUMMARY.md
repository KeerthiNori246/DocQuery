# Vercel Deployment Fix - Summary

## 🎯 Problem Fixed
Fixed the **"Missing public directory"** and other Vercel deployment errors that were preventing successful deployment of the DocQuery application after 17 attempts.

## 🔧 Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Conflicting Configuration** (vercel.json)
**Problem**: The `vercel.json` had both `builds` and `functions` properties, which creates conflicts according to Vercel documentation.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `builds` and `routes` (legacy configuration)
- Used modern `functions`, `rewrites`, and `redirects` configuration
- Added proper CORS headers for API endpoints

### 2. **Build Script Configuration**
**Problem**: While the build script existed, the Vercel configuration wasn't properly referencing it.

**Solution**:
- Added `buildCommand: "npm run build"` to vercel.json
- Added `outputDirectory: "public"` to specify where static files are generated
- Verified build script generates all required files

### 3. **Dependencies Optimization**
**Problem**: Heavy dependencies causing potential build timeouts.

**Solution**:
- Streamlined `requirements.txt` for faster deployment
- Removed optional heavy packages (sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu)
- Kept essential packages for core functionality
- Created `.vercelignore` to exclude unnecessary files

### 4. **API Structure**
**Problem**: The API export wasn't properly structured for Vercel serverless functions.

**Solution**:
- Simplified the Vercel handler to `app = app`
- Ensured proper FastAPI app export
- Maintained all API functionality while optimizing for serverless

## ✅ Verification Results

All deployment requirements now satisfied:
