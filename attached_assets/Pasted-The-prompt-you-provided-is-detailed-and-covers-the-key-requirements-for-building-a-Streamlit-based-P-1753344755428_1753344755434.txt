The prompt you provided is detailed and covers the key requirements for building a Streamlit-based Python web app that processes PDF uploads, extracts query details, and integrates with FAISS and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. However, to ensure the app is fully functional and runnable in Replit, the prompt could be improved for clarity, specificity, and compatibility with Replit's environment. Below, I'll refine the prompt to make it more precise, address potential Replit-specific constraints, and ensure all necessary details are included. I'll then provide the complete code for the app wrapped in an <xaiArtifact> tag, as per the guidelines.

Refined Prompt
Build a full web-based Python app using Streamlit that runs entirely in Replit, with the following functionality:

Allow the user to upload a PDF file (e.g., a health insurance policy document) via a Streamlit file uploader.
Provide a text input box for the user to enter a natural language query (e.g., "46M, knee surgery in Pune, 3-month-old insurance policy").
Parse the query to extract key details: age, gender, procedure, location, and policy duration. Use regex or simple string parsing; do not rely on external NLP services for this step.
Extract all text from the uploaded PDF using PyPDF2 or pdfplumber.
Split the extracted text into chunks (e.g., by paragraphs or fixed-size chunks) and generate embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from the sentence-transformers library.
Store the document embeddings in a FAISS index for efficient similarity search.
Use the query to search the FAISS index and retrieve the top 3 relevant policy clauses.
Prompt the user to input their OpenAI API key securely via a Streamlit text input (masked as a password).
Send the extracted query details and relevant policy chunks to the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model via its API, with a prompt that requests a JSON response containing:
decision: "Approved" or "Rejected"
justification: Reason for the decision based on the policy clauses
clause_reference: Specific clause number or text referenced
Display the extracted query details and the GPT-3.5 response in a clear, structured format in the Streamlit app.
Implement error handling for:
Missing or invalid PDF uploads
Invalid or incomplete queries
Missing or invalid OpenAI API key
API call failures or network issues
General exceptions during PDF parsing or embedding generation
Ensure the app is user-friendly with clear instructions, error messages, and a clean Streamlit interface.
Ensure compatibility with Replit by:
Using only Python libraries available in Replit (e.g., streamlit, PyPDF2, sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu, openai, numpy).
Avoiding local file I/O beyond the uploaded PDF.
Including a requirements.txt file for all dependencies.
Providing a .replit file to configure the Streamlit app to run on port 8501.
Do not hardcode any inputs, including the OpenAI API key or sample PDF/query. All inputs must be provided dynamically by the user through the Streamlit interface.
The app should be fully coded in Python, runnable in Replit, and include all necessary configuration files (requirements.txt and .replit) to ensure it works out of the box.
