Update the existing frontend UI to reflect the new layout inspired by the POLICYsure wireframe, while preserving the current functionalities and logic. Begin by adding a top navigation bar titled "POLICYsure" aligned to the left, and place "Login" and "Signup" options on the right side of the navbar. During both login and signup processes, include a toggle or dropdown for selecting either "Admin" or "User" roles.

On the left side of the interface, add a collapsible sidebar, which opens when clicking the three-line icon (hamburger menu). This sidebar should contain a search box with the placeholder "search...". Below the search box, include a section labeled "Documents of all existing policies in PDF format (inbuilt)" followed by an expandable area labeled "Configuration details" which provides two radio buttons – one for selecting "OpenAI" and another for "Local AI (no API key needed)". Include a "Settings" link below this section and a button at the bottom for toggling between Dark and Light modes.

In the main center area of the page, display a short description of the app and its purpose. Just below that, provide a user input section with a textbox that carries the placeholder "type your queries here...". To the right of this input box, place three action buttons: one with a plus (+) symbol that allows users to upload documents in any format including PDF, Word, and text files; another with a green tick that represents inbuilt queries or system-generated suggestions; and a violet circle icon which serves as the send button to submit the user's query.

Towards the bottom part of the main panel, add a "History" section that displays the number of documents uploaded and the number of queries answered. Additionally, include an FAQ section with sample questions like "How to use this app?" and "Can we give prompt without login?". Ensure the entire layout follows a clean structure using flex or grid-based design, separating the top navigation, sidebar, and main content area logically without disrupting any of the app’s current features or styling.
